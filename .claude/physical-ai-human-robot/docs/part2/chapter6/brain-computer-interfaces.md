# Brain-Computer Interfaces

Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are devices that allow users to control a computer or other electronic device with their thoughts. BCIs work by detecting and interpreting brain signals, which then are used to control the device.

There are many different types of BCIs, each with its own unique set of capabilities. Some common types of BCIs include:

- **Electroencephalography (EEG):** This is a non-invasive technique that measures brain activity through electrodes placed on the scalp.
- **Electrocorticography (ECoG):** This is an invasive technique that measures brain activity through electrodes placed directly on the surface of the brain.
- **Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI):** This is a non-invasive technique that measures brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow.

The development of new and improved BCIs is an active area of research. Researchers are working on developing devices that are more accurate, reliable, and easy to use. These advances will enable the development of more sophisticated and capable BCIs in the future.

## Questions

1.  What is the fundamental principle behind Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), and how do they enable control via thought?
2.  Compare and contrast two types of BCIs (e.g., EEG, ECoG, fMRI) in terms of their invasiveness and method of brain activity measurement.
3.  What are the primary goals of current BCI research, and what potential does improved BCI technology hold for human-computer interaction?
