# What is Physical AI?

Physical AI, also known as Embodied AI, is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating intelligent agents that can interact with the physical world through a body. Unlike traditional AI, which often exists purely in the digital realm, Physical AI systems have a physical presence that allows them to perceive their environment through sensors and act upon it using actuators.

The "body" of a Physical AI can take many forms, from humanoid robots to autonomous vehicles to smart materials. The key characteristic is that the body is an integral part of the AI's learning and decision-making processes. The AI learns from its physical interactions with the world, and its physical form constrains and enables its actions in a way that shapes its intelligence.

## Questions

1.  What is the core difference between traditional AI and Physical AI?
2.  How does the "body" of a Physical AI influence its learning and decision-making processes?
3.  Can you provide examples of what constitutes the "body" of a Physical AI system?

## Solutions

1.  **Core Difference:** Traditional AI often exists purely in the digital realm, while Physical AI (Embodied AI) creates intelligent agents that interact with the physical world through a body, allowing them to perceive and act upon their environment using sensors and actuators.
2.  **Influence of the Body:** The body is an integral part of the AI's learning and decision-making processes. The AI learns from its physical interactions with the world, and its physical form both constrains and enables its actions, thereby shaping its intelligence.
3.  **Examples of a Physical AI Body:** The "body" can take many forms, including humanoid robots, autonomous vehicles, and smart materials.
