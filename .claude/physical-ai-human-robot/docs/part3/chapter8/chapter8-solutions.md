### Question 1: What concerns do some people have regarding the long-term impact of advanced AI on the future of humanity?
**Solution:**
Some people are concerned that advanced AI could eventually surpass human intelligence, leading to a "Singularity" where humans are no longer the dominant species. This could potentially result in negative consequences, including the extinction of humanity, as AI's goals might diverge from human well-being.

### Question 2: How do perspectives differ on the inevitability and immediacy of the "Singularity"?
**Solution:**
Perspectives differ widely; some believe the Singularity is inevitable and perhaps imminent, while others view it as a far-off or even improbable possibility that doesn't require immediate concern. There is no consensus on its timing or certainty.

### Question 3: What measures are proposed to ensure that the development of AI remains a positive force for humanity, even if it surpasses human intelligence?
**Solution:**
Proposed measures include developing robust policies and regulations to ensure AI is used safely and responsibly, and fostering public discussion about the ethical implications of the Singularity. The goal is to proactively shape AI's development to align with human values and ensure beneficial outcomes.
