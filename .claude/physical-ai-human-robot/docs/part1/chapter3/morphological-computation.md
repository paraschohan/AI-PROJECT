# Morphological Computation

Morphological computation is the idea that the physical form of a robot can be used to perform computation. This is in contrast to the traditional view of computation, which is typically seen as a process that happens in a central processing unit (CPU).

The idea of morphological computation is based on the observation that the body of an animal is not just a passive vessel for its brain, but is an active participant in the cognitive process. For example, the shape of a cheetah's body allows it to run at high speeds, and the structure of a bird's wings allows it to fly. In the same way, the physical form of a robot can be designed to perform specific computations.

For example, a robot with a snake-like body can be used to navigate through tight spaces. The robot's body can be designed to bend and twist in a way that allows it to move through the space without hitting any obstacles. This is an example of how the physical form of a robot can be used to perform a computation that would be difficult or impossible for a traditional CPU to perform.

The study of morphological computation is an active area of research in the field of robotics. Researchers are working on developing new ways to design and control robots that can exploit the principles of morphological computation. These advances will enable the development of more capable and sophisticated robots that can perform a wider range of tasks.
