  "description": "Embodied cognition is the theory that the body plays a central role in shaping the mind. It is the idea that cognition is not just a process that happens in the brain, but is also influenced by the body's interactions with the world. This theory has important implications for the field of Physical AI, as it suggests that the body of an AI is not just a passive vessel for its intelligence, but is an active participant in the cognitive process.",
