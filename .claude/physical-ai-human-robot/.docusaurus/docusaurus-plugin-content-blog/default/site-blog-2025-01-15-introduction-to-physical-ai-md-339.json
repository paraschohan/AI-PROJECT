  "description": "Physical AI, also known as Embodied AI, represents a paradigm shift from traditional digital-only AI systems to intelligent agents that interact with the physical world through a body. Unlike conventional AI that operates purely in the digital realm, Physical AI systems have a physical presence that allows them to perceive their environment through sensors and act upon it using actuators.",
